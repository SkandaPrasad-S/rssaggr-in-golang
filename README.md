# RSS Aggregator in Go with Chi Router

This project aims to develop an RSS aggregator using Go programming language along with the Chi router. The aggregator will fetch and organize RSS feeds from various sources for easy consumption.

## Setup

1. **Database Migration**: Use Goose to manage database migrations. Navigate to the `sql/schema` directory and run migrations with the following command:
    ```bash
    goose postgres postgres://postgres:skanda123@localhost:5432/rssagg up
    ```
    This command will apply database migrations located in the `sql/schema` directory.

2. **Generate SQLC Queries**: Generate SQLC queries to interact with the database. Run the following command in the root directory:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" -w /src sqlc/sqlc generate
    ```
    This will generate Go code for type-safe SQL queries based on the SQL files located in the `sql/queries` directory.

3. **Build and Run**: Build the Go application and run the server. Execute the following commands:
    ```bash
    go build
    ./rssaggr.exe
    ```
    This will build the application and start the server listening on port 8000.

## Usage

1. **RSS Feed Aggregation**: The server will aggregate RSS feeds from various sources.

2. **API Endpoints**: The server exposes API endpoints for interacting with the aggregated feeds.

3. **Authentication**: Implement authentication middleware for secure access to the API endpoints.
